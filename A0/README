## Compilation
- Steps
    $ premake4 gmake
    $ make
    $ ./A0

- There is no modification to the default premake4/make.
- No additional assumptions. (Presumbly cs488 directory should be downloaded and installed as instructed on the course website)
- The computer I used to run in lab is GL35

## Manual
- No extra commands, features, files has been added
- When Q,R,-,+ keys are pressed, the program prints in console about which key is pressed.
- The constant change factor for triangle's size is 0.25. I use that number because it doesn't hurt your finger to increase the size to maximum and the change is pretty noticible, but it also gives 40 different size options for the triangle!
- The rotation slider is below the RGB slider because it is mentioned after RGB slider.
