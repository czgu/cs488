## Compilation
- Steps
    $ premake4 gmake
    $ make
    $ ./A4

- There is no modification to the default premake4/make.
- No additional assumptions. (Presumbly cs488 directory should be downloaded and installed as instructed on the course website)
- The computer I used to run in lab is GL15

## Manual
- the missing feature is the extra feature we are required to implement.
- only issue running command in the /A4 directory. Eg. ./A4 sample.lua. Don't do: cd Assets/; ../A4 nonhier.lua.
- I load a sunset bmp image and set it as the static background of ray casting.
