## Compilation
- Steps
    $ premake4 gmake
    $ make
    $ ./A2

- There is no modification to the default premake4/make.
- No additional assumptions. (Presumbly cs488 directory should be downloaded and installed as instructed on the course website)
- The computer I used to run in lab is GL13

## Manual

- gnomon are represented with 4 vertices and 3 lines, x axis is red, y axis is green, z axis is blue, they also get clipped
- rotations of axis are occured in rotation along x-axis, y-axis, and lastly z-axis order
