## Compilation
- Steps
    $ premake4 gmake
    $ make
    $ ./A2

- There is no modification to the default premake4/make.
- No additional assumptions. (Presumbly cs488 directory should be downloaded and installed as instructed on the course website)
- The computer I used to run in lab is GL13

## Manual
